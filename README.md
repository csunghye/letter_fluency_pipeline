# Letter-guided fluency pipeline

This pipeline processes audio files of letter-guided fluency tasks, automatically calculates scores and rates several language measures per word (or per word pair for semantic and phonetic similarities). It requires audio files and corresponding forced aligned outputs when processing. After processing, it generates two comma-separated files: one file for automatically calculated scores and the other for language measures per word. To run the program, enter a command like the following:

`python3 letter_fluency_pipeline.py -score_file score.csv -measure_file results.csv -audio_folder /audio_location -FA_folder /FA_location -letter f  -glove_folder /glove`

## Prerequisites

- GloVe: (https://nlp.stanford.edu/projects/glove/) 
- Python packages: `spacy`, `scipy`, `pydub`, `py-dtw`, `librosa`, `numpy`, `pandas`, `nltk` 

The 6B.300d GloVe word embedding file is used to calculate semantic distance between words, and the large language model ('en_core_web_lg') from spaCy is used for POS tagging (which is used to calculate the numbers of proper nouns and numerics that are not counted as correct response in letter-guided fluency tasks.) Please make sure that users have all the packages installed before running the program.

## Arguments and options

- `-score_file`: This is a required argument for the output file name for the score file.   
- `-measure_file`: This is also a required argument for the output file name for the measure file. 
- `-audio_folder`: This is also a required argument for the folder name where audio files are. 
- `-FA_folder`: This is also a required argument for the folder name where forced alignemtn results are. Note that the alignment files should be **tab-separated** and need to include pause duration between words.  
- `-FA_filetype`: This is an optional argument (type: `str`) and users can indicate their FA output filetype (e.g., `*.txt`). If not entered, the default `*.word` will be used. Note that users cannot use Praat textgrids for FA outputs.
- `-letter`: This is a required argument. Please enter the letter of the letter-guided fluency task, e.g., f.
- `-glove_folder`: This is also a required argument for the location of GloVe word embedding files. 

## Measurements
This pipeline measures the following:
### Score file
- Number of total words: Total number of words starting with a given letter including proper nouns, numerics, and repetitions
- Number of proper nouns: The number of proper nouns starting with a given letter (e.g., "Fanta" for "f")
- Number of numerics: The number of numeric words starting with a given letter (e.g., "forty" for "f")
- Number of repetitions: The number of repeated answers starting with a given letter. This count is based on lemma of words, so "flower" and "flowers" are considered as a repetition.  

So, the actual score of a speaker would be total number of words - (number of proper nouns + numerics + repetitions). 

### Language measure file
- Previous pause duration: The pause duration between the previous correct response and the current correct response. This includes the duration of partial words (e.g., "f-", "fu-"), fillers (e.g., "um", "uh"), and all words that do not start with a given letter (e.g., "Wow, this is difficult!").
- Word duration: The duration of correct responses. 
- Number of syllables: The number of syllables of correct responses from the CMU dictionary
- Several lexical measures of correct responses: Age of acquisition (AoA), word frequncy, word familiarity, semantic ambiguity, concreteness: These measures are based on published norms. See [Citation](#citation)
- Semantic distance between the previous correct response and the current correct response: This measure is calculated with GloVe word embeddings.
- Phonetic distance between the previous correct response and the current correct response: Phonetic similarity is measured by extracting 1st to 13th MFCC values of the previous and the currect correct responses, applying dynamic time warping to normalize duration, and calculating an Euclidean distance between two time-warped matrices.

## Note
I've seen many people using a cluster approach, but this hasn't been implemented here yet. I will explore cluster approaches tried in previous studies later and implement one in this pipeline.
